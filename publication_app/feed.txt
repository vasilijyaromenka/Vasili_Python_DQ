Inside tasmania's famous museum of old and new art lies a large,
emerald-draped cube. the walls are thick silk curtains. within them, a
cascading chandelier hangs over a phallus-shaped velvet couch and a
chequered marble floor. opulent gold accents everything - from the
framed art on the walls to the furniture. women are ushered in and
offered champagne by male butlers "who live to serve" them. but men
are otherwise noticeably absent, turned away at the entrance. this
"ladies lounge" takes the concept of an old australian pub and turns
it on its head. it was only in 1965 that women won the right to drink
in the nation's bars. previously, they were relegated to dingy side
rooms, if admitted at all, and often charged exorbitant prices for
their tipple. and so, the exhibit - which contains some of the
museum's most-acclaimed works, from picasso to sidney nolan - was
designed as a piece of interactive art, intended to provide a safe
place for women to enjoy each other's company, while also highlighting
the exclusion they faced for decades.

Gen x workers are being passed over for roles of all kinds, especially
as employers see young people as more malleable. the timing couldn't
be worse.  since his layoff last may, nick, a 49-year-old hr executive
based in the us, estimates he's applied for hundreds of jobs. he
secured interviews at 10 companies, and made it to the final round at
four of them. each time, the position went to a younger candidate.
"it's tough not to take it personally," he says. "i have an excellent
track record and lots of experience. a company should be lucky to have
me, right?"  throughout his search, nick has received lots of advice
on how to position himself as a job candidate in his demographic. one
head-hunter suggested he remove his education dates from his linkedin
profile to prevent employers from calculating his age. a recent
encounter with a hiring manager, however, was not as subtle. "he said
to me, 'you can't make many more pivots in your career at this
point'," says nick. "the implication was that my prior job might have
been my last. it was blatant ageism."   ageism has long been a concern
in the job market, but the confluence of mass layoffs, post-pandemic
economic uncertainty and rapid technological change – including the
emergence of ai – is hitting gen xers particularly hard. according
to a 2022 aarp survey, roughly 80% of workers between the ages of 40
and 65 reported having either witnessed or personally faced age
discrimination at work. this percentage represents the highest
recorded by the organisation since it began conducting polls on the
issue among older adults in 2003.
