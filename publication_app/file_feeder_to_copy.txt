Inside Tasmania's famous Museum of Old and New Art lies a large, emerald-draped cube.
The walls are thick silk curtains. Within them, a cascading chandelier hangs over a phallus-shaped velvet couch and a chequered marble floor. Opulent gold accents everything - from the framed art on the walls to the furniture.
Women are ushered in and offered champagne by male butlers "who live to serve" them. But men are otherwise noticeably absent, turned away at the entrance.
This "Ladies Lounge" takes the concept of an old Australian pub and turns it on its head.
It was only in 1965 that women won the right to drink in the nation's bars. Previously, they were relegated to dingy side rooms, if admitted at all, and often charged exorbitant prices for their tipple.
And so, the exhibit - which contains some of the museum's most-acclaimed works, from Picasso to Sidney Nolan - was designed as a piece of interactive art, intended to provide a safe place for women to enjoy each other's company, while also highlighting the exclusion they faced for decades.

Gen X workers are being passed over for roles of all kinds, especially as employers see young people as more malleable. The timing couldn't be worse.

Since his layoff last May, Nick, a 49-year-old HR executive based in the US, estimates he's applied for hundreds of jobs. He secured interviews at 10 companies, and made it to the final round at four of them. Each time, the position went to a younger candidate.

"It's tough not to take it personally," he says. "I have an excellent track record and lots of experience. A company should be lucky to have me, right?"

Throughout his search, Nick has received lots of advice on how to position himself as a job candidate in his demographic. One head-hunter suggested he remove his education dates from his LinkedIn profile to prevent employers from calculating his age. A recent encounter with a hiring manager, however, was not as subtle. "He said to me, 'You can't make many more pivots in your career at this point'," says Nick. "The implication was that my prior job might have been my last. It was blatant ageism." 

Ageism has long been a concern in the job market, but the confluence of mass layoffs, post-pandemic economic uncertainty and rapid technological change – including the emergence of AI – is hitting Gen Xers particularly hard. According to a 2022 AARP survey, roughly 80% of workers between the ages of 40 and 65 reported having either witnessed or personally faced age discrimination at work. This percentage represents the highest recorded by the organisation since it began conducting polls on the issue among older adults in 2003.
